# GENSE

If you work with global variables: 
1. Run image_processing.py
2. Run region_growing.py
3. Run reference_advanced.py
4. Run reference_segm.py
5. Open notebook_3Dmesh.ipynb
6. Run each cell 

Else : 
1. Add in region_growing.py "from image_processing import *"
2. Add in reference_advanced.py "from image_processing import *" and "from region_growing import *"
3. Add in reference_segm.py from image_processing import *" and "from region_growing import *" and "from reference_advanced import *" 
5. Open notebook_3Dmesh.ipynb
6. Run each cell 


If the notebook doesn't work, you can find the code in the file 3Dmesh.py.
